# Personal Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of the front-end and full-stack projects I have developed to showcase my skills and learning progress. Each project is organized into its own branch for easy navigation.

1- HTML/CSS-Project Branch: A responsive website designed for a technology fair, showcasing event details, schedules, and featured speakers. Developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and SASS for a modern and visually appealing layout. The project incorporates minimal JavaScript for form validation during user registration and a countdown timer to generate excitement for the event.

2- JavaScript-Project Branch: An interactive web application that utilizes the JSONPlaceholder API to manage artist profiles and visitor interactions. Users can join as either visitors or artists, with a dropdown menu displaying registered artists (the ones taken from the API jsonplaceholder). Upon selecting an artist's name, users can view their total sold items, total income, and a dynamic graph created with Chart.js, comparing sold prices to original prices. The navigation bar includes an option for artists to manage their items, allowing them to add, delete, and edit artwork effortlessly.

3- ImgGallery-JS Branch: A simple image gallery slideshow created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a responsive layout with Bootstrap for styling. Users can navigate through a collection of images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons, as well as keyboard arrow keys for enhanced interactivity. The slideshow dynamically updates the displayed image, showcasing the selected artwork in a visually appealing format.

4- StudyTimer-JS Branch: A user-friendly study timer application that helps manage study and break durations effectively. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project allows users to set their desired study and break times, which are saved using local storage for convenience. The timer features a progress bar that visually represents the session's progress and notifies users upon completion. Additionally, it maintains a history of previous study sessions, displaying details such as date, time, and durations, making it easy for users to track their study habits over time.

5- WeatherDashboard-JS Branch: The Weather Dashboard is a dynamic web application designed to provide users with real-time weather information for their chosen cities. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application allows users to enter a city name to retrieve current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app also offers a 5-day forecast, giving users a glimpse into future weather patterns.

6- DayPlanner-JS Branch: A Day Planner project is a simple web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. Users can input task descriptions, times, and dates, which are then displayed in a list. The application highlights tasks scheduled for the current date, providing a visual cue for upcoming responsibilities. Users can easily add new tasks, remove existing ones, and the task list is saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring that tasks persist even after a page reload. This makes it a convenient tool for organizing and planning daily activities.

7- MusicApp-React Branch: A Music Application built with React is designed to allow users to explore artists and their albums. It features a component-based structure with a Navbar for easy navigation to the homepage, where individual artist items are displayed. Each artist item links to a detailed ArtistPage, showcasing specific information about the artist. The application also includes an AlbumsList that displays all albums associated with an artist, with each album linking to its corresponding AlbumPage for more details. Utilizing react-router, the app ensures smooth navigation and a user-friendly experience.
