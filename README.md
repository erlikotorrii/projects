# Personal Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of the front-end and full-stack projects I have developed to showcase my skills and learning progress. Each project is organized into its own branch for easy navigation.

## Project Overview
### HTML/CSS-Project Branch
A responsive website designed for a technology fair, featuring event details, schedules, and speaker profiles. Developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and SASS for a visually appealing layout. The project includes minimal JavaScript for form validation during user registration and a countdown timer to create excitement for the event.

### JavaScript-Project Branch
An interactive web application using the JSONPlaceholder API to manage artist profiles and visitor interactions. Users can join as either visitors or artists, with a dropdown menu displaying registered artists (from the API). Selecting an artist's name shows their total sold items, total income, and a dynamic graph comparing sold prices to original prices, created with Chart.js. The navigation bar allows artists to manage their items, including adding, deleting, and editing artworks.

### ImgGallery-JS Branch
A simple image gallery slideshow developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a responsive layout with Bootstrap for styling. Users can navigate through images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons, as well as keyboard arrow keys. The slideshow dynamically updates the displayed image, showcasing selected artwork in a clean and engaging format.

### StudyTimer-JS Branch
A study timer application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help users manage study and break durations effectively. Users can set study and break times, which are saved in local storage for convenience. The timer includes a progress bar and notifications upon completion, along with a history of previous sessions for tracking study habits over time.

### WeatherDashboard-JS Branch
A dynamic web application providing real-time weather information for selected cities. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application retrieves current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It also offers a 5-day forecast, enabling users to view upcoming weather patterns.

### DayPlanner-JS Branch
A simple day planner application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. Tasks can be input with descriptions, times, and dates, and are displayed in a list. The app highlights tasks scheduled for the current date and allows users to add and remove tasks. The task list is saved in local storage, ensuring persistence across page reloads.

### MusicApp-React Branch
A music application built with React, designed to allow users to explore artists and their albums. The app features a component-based structure with a Navbar for easy navigation to the homepage. Each artist item links to a detailed ArtistPage, and the AlbumsList displays all albums associated with an artist, linking to the corresponding AlbumPage for more details. React-router ensures smooth navigation for an enhanced user experience.

### NextJS-Project Branch
A front-end web application developed with Next.js for Cyberware Global Defence, featuring multiple pages that showcase the companyâ€™s services, technologies, and solutions. The project follows a clean, scalable architecture and provides a seamless user experience across all pages.
